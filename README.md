# GPA Calculator

This project was made so I did not have to constantly reinput my grades and credit hours into a website online to find out my GPA (or what it will be). This program takes in the file location of a txt file which contains the class name, credit hours, and grades of all your classes. The txt file has to be formatted in a specific way however, as I have not developed the program enough to deal with different formats. The format is shown below with additional information below the image:

*Make sure the spacing is as shown and that colons and commas are placed correctly.
*Capitalization does not matter for class names, or labels (Class, Credit Hours, Grade), however, it does matter for the grade letter.
*You can seperate semesters by skipping a line.
*You can input a semester with classes whose grades are not finalized. Just input "X" as the grade and the program will not count it in your GPA calculation. (An example of this is the last semester in the image above)
